<h1>Vecna</h1>
<p> This game is based off Software Architecture & Design's (see YouTube) iteration of chess in Java. There are word-for-word lines of code, but also some reworked lines, keywords, classes, etc. </p>
<p> This game is intended for people who wish to see a version of chess game done completely in the Java programming language. </p> 
<p> For me, this is not only a way for me to practice and learn Java, but also a way for me to understand how chess works. </p>
